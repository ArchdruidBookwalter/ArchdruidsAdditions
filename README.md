This mod is a work-in-progress! It currently adds two brand new items, an ominous red flower that stuns nearby enemies when thrown, and a sword that can parry most enemy attacks.
Both can be spawned in with Beastmaster, and the flower can be placed into a level with Devtools. Future additions may include more consumable items, and potentially new creatures as well.
If you find any bugs, or if you have any questions or advice, feel free to contact me via u/dogarfdog12 on Reddit!

PS: Everything in this mod is free to use by anyone, includinag region mod developers. If you would like to add anything from this mod to your region, go right ahead!
Be my guest! I'm always happy to see new things on the Workshop, even more so to know I helped contribute to it!
